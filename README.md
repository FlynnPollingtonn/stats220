# STATS220 Repo
## Flynn
This is my repo for my STATS 220 course,  
If you want to find out more about this course here's a link: [*Link*](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213)
The coding languages that will be covered through this work in this repo are:
+ **R**
+ **HTML**
+ **Markdown**
This repo will be usful to me because:
1. It will serve as a place to store all my work for stats 220 over the semester.
2. It will serve as a point of reference for future revision
3. It allows other to see my Skills in HTML, R, Markdown and so on.
